## Linear Regression to Predict 
![linear_regression](https://github.com/codepast12/Mechacar/blob/main/Resources/Linear_Regression.png)
The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset is AWD, the spoiler angle, and potentially the vehicle weight.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The standard deviation would suggest that the difference between the lots does not meet the requirements of all three lots being within the required design. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
![t_test](https://github.com/codepast12/Mechacar/blob/main/Resources/T-Tests.png)
Since significance level is around 0.05 percent, and our p-value is above our significance level of .06 -- we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore the means are statistically similar.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Various components were compared in this analysis, one of note being the psi within the suspension coils being produced. The null hypothesis tested that there is a significant difference between different lots and their manufacturing results in terms of psi within the suspension coils. In this analysis a T-test was used to find out what the p-value was which was then used to compare against the hypothesis. This T-test was based off of various data points derived from tables created from csv files. The data gathered were lot numbers, psi readings, and product ID numbers.
